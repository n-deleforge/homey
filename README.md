## Changelog

- 1.9.9 : Again, I decided to cancel the CSS files thing. It would work great but it's completely not nice to work like that but I didn't want a complete CSS part in the app so I made a mix of everything and I added the possibility to change 4 main colors directly in the app. It works great and it's much easier. Also in the future, maybe I'll add more colors to change.
- 1.9 : Big changes. Now it's possible to edit CSS in live witthout modify CSS files. It is also possible to hide some elements as the date, the weather or the welcome message.
