# Homey

> Version 1.1 :memo:  
> A personal start page for your browser with date, weather and favs.

## How to use it ?

You can try the tool : https://nicolas-deleforge.fr/apps/homey/  
Or download it : https://github.com/n-deleforge/homey/archive/main.zip  
Or clone the git : ```git clone https://github.com/n-deleforge/homey.git```

## How does it work ?

Everything is stored localy on your device but you can export your data (name, weather, favs etc.) and then import it on another device.  
The application is written in pure JavaScript so no depencies are needed, except a modern browser.

## Settings

There are some variables to set up in the main.js / min.js file :
- `language` : by default, the app is in french but you can put it in English too. Or you can create a new object (copy/paste the EN object for example) and change the values to your language.
